# Components 

## 1.Core Components

a. Storage Engine
•	In-memory (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap) to start
•	Persistent storage (e.g., append-only log, SSTables, or LSM Trees)
•	Write-ahead logging (WAL) for durability
•	Compaction/merging strategies

b. Networking Layer
•	Use Netty for efficient request handling
•	Define a simple binary or text-based protocol (like Redis or Memcached)
•	Handle commands like GET, SET, DELETE, etc.

⸻

## 2. Distribution Layer

a. Cluster Membership
•	Static config to start (e.g., list of nodes)
•	Eventually: implement gossip protocols or use tools like ZooKeeper or Raft-based membership

b. Data Partitioning
•	Consistent hashing or range-based partitioning
•	Map keys to nodes based on a hash ring or shard map

c. Replication
•	Decide replication factor (e.g., 3)
•	Synchronous vs. asynchronous replication
•	Leader-based or quorum-style (like Dynamo)

⸻

## 3. Consensus & Coordination

If you want strong consistency:
•	Implement Raft (simpler than Paxos)
•	Or use external coordination service (e.g., etcd, ZooKeeper)

Or go eventually consistent (like DynamoDB):
•	Use vector clocks or versioning
•	Implement read-repair, hinted handoff, anti-entropy

⸻

## 4. Client Protocol
   •	Binary/text-based protocol
   •	REST or gRPC interface (for external access)
   •	Java client library with smart routing (optional)

⸻

## 5. Fault Tolerance & Recovery
   •	Node crash and recovery (WAL replay, data re-replication)
   •	Network partitions
   •	Split-brain prevention

⸻

## 6. Performance Optimization
   •	Connection pooling
   •	Batching writes
   •	Buffer pooling
   •	Bloom filters (to avoid unnecessary disk reads)
   •	Compression and serialization formats (e.g., ProtoBuf)

⸻

## 7. Monitoring & Metrics
   •	Expose internal metrics (latency, throughput, cache hits, memory usage)
   •	Use JMX, Micrometer, or Prometheus exporters

⸻

## 8. Testing & Tooling
   •	Unit tests for storage engine and protocol parsing
   •	Integration tests for replication and failover
   •	Chaos testing for node failures
   •	Benchmarking tools (e.g., YCSB or custom load generators)

⸻

Optional: Features You Can Add Later
•	Time-to-live (TTL) support
•	Transactions (multi-key atomic ops)
•	Watch/notify on key changes
•	Multi-tenancy
•	Security (auth, TLS, ACLs)

# Project Milestones

## Phase 1: MVP — Single-Node Key-Value Store

Goal: Get a working, persistent key-value store running on a single machine.

Tasks:
•	Implement in-memory key-value store (ConcurrentHashMap)
•	Add basic CLI or API interface (e.g., Netty server or REST)
•	Add persistent storage (write-ahead log)
•	Add log replay on restart (basic crash recovery)
•	Add basic unit tests

Milestone 1:
•	You can GET, SET, and DELETE keys via the network, and data persists across restarts.

⸻

## Phase 2: Networking Protocol and Client Interface

Goal: Define how clients talk to the database.

Tasks:
•	Design a simple TCP protocol (text-based or binary)
•	Implement Netty server to parse requests
•	Add protocol handler (command routing, validation)
•	Write a basic client CLI (or Java client lib)

Milestone 2:
•	Clients can talk to your store over TCP using a simple protocol (like Redis or Memcached style).

⸻

## Phase 3: Sharding & Distribution

Goal: Run multiple nodes and distribute data between them.

Tasks:
•	Implement consistent hashing (or range-based sharding)
•	Map keys to nodes
•	Implement basic routing logic (either in client or via a coordinator node)
•	Add cluster config (list of peers, static for now)

Milestone 3:
•	Keys are automatically partitioned across multiple nodes.

⸻

## Phase 4: Replication

Goal: Make the system fault-tolerant by replicating data.

Tasks:
•	Add support for a configurable replication factor (e.g., 3)
•	Implement asynchronous replication (SET on one node triggers replication to peers)
•	Handle failed replicas and retry logic
•	Add GET fallback to replicas if the primary is down

Milestone 4:
•	Your system tolerates node failures without data loss.

⸻

## Phase 5: Fault Recovery

Goal: Handle node crashes and restarts gracefully.

Tasks:
•	On startup, replay WAL and rebuild in-memory state
•	Add hinted handoff or re-replication for missed writes
•	Detect failed nodes (basic heartbeats)
•	Rebalance data if needed (optional)

Milestone 5:
•	Crashed nodes recover automatically, and the cluster self-heals missing data.

⸻

## Phase 6: Consistency Guarantees

Goal: Choose and implement a consistency model.

Choose one:

a) Eventual Consistency (Dynamo-style)
•	Implement vector clocks or versioning
•	Conflict resolution on GET
•	Read-repair on GET
•	Anti-entropy background sync

b) Strong Consistency (Raft-based)
•	Implement leader election (Raft)
•	Write through leader only
•	Replicate via consensus
•	Handle partition healing

Milestone 6:
•	Your store supports a well-defined consistency model.

⸻

## Phase 7: Observability & Operations

Goal: Make the system operable and observable.

Tasks:
•	Expose metrics (e.g., request rate, latency, memory usage)
•	Add Prometheus/JMX/Micrometer support
•	Add logging (request logs, failure logs)
•	Write a load tester and monitor under stress

Milestone 7:
•	You can monitor your system under load and get insight into performance and failures.

⸻

Bonus: Advanced Features

These are nice-to-have and can be added iteratively:
•	TTL support (key expiry)
•	Batching & pipelining for performance
•	Compression (e.g., Snappy/LZ4)
•	ACLs and authentication
•	gRPC or HTTP-based admin APIs
•	Backup and restore tooling
•	Hot config reloading
